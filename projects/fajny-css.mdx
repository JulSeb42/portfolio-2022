<Section title="Overview">

Tired of using Bootstrap and other heavy CSS frameworks, and reusing a lot of components at my job, I decided to create my own SCSS framework to save time on the development process. The idea of Fajny (pronounce /ˈfaj.nɨ/, meaning cool in Polish) was to make a light weight, complete, easy to use and to personalise SCSS framework. It is of course responsive.

The first version did not use JavaScript, but the 2.0 uses a bit, with always SCSS counterparts.
