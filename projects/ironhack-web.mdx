<Section title="Overview">

During IronHack Web Developmnent Bootcamp, I had to work on several projects.

For all of them I had a week to code an app on a subject I chose.

</Section>

<Section title="Artists booking app">

#### Context

Website to book artists / bands for private events. Anyone can register on the app, as a normal user or an artist, and users can contact artists from a form.

#### Challenge

How to facilitate artists booking for private events?

#### Features

The idea was to create a single page app in React, with an Express / MongoDb backend. Users can see a list of all artists, filter them by location / price / etc., visit artists profile pages, and contact them by email, directly from a contact form. Artists can register, change information about them, and their visibility on the website.

#### Demo

You can log in as a user with `a@b.com` for email, and `Password42` for the password. To login as an artist, you can use `b@c.com`, and use the same password.
