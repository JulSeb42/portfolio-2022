<Section title="Overview">

<Fade>

During IronHack Web Developmnent Bootcamp, I had to work on several projects.

</Fade>

<Fade>

For all of them I had a week to code an app on a subject I chose.

</Fade>

<Section title="Artists booking app">

<Fade>

For all of them I had a week to code an app on a subject I chose.

</Fade>

<Fade>

Website to book artists / bands for private events. Anyone can register on the app, as a normal user or an artist, and users can contact artists from a form.

</Fade>

<Fade>

#### Challenge

</Fade>

<Fade>

How to facilitate artists booking for private events?

</Fade>

<Fade>

#### Features

</Fade>

<Fade>

The idea was to create a single page app in React, with an Express / MongoDb backend. Users can see a list of all artists, filter them by location / price / etc., visit artists profile pages, and contact them by email, directly from a contact form. Artists can register, change information about them, and their visibility on the website.

</Fade>

<Fade>

#### Demo

</Fade>

<Fade>

You can log in as a user with `a@b.com` for email, and `Password42` for the password. To login as an artist, you can use `b@c.com`, and use the same password.

<Section title="Events app">

<Fade>

#### Context

</Fade>

<Fade>

A mini social network, where users can organise events, like on Facebook. This app was developped in Handlebars, JavaScript and SCSS for the front end, and Express / MongoDb for the backend.

</Fade>

<Fade>

#### Features

</Fade>

<Fade>

The idea was to create a full stack app where anyone can organise events. This project was created for people who do not like social networks, but still want to be aware of events in their area. The content is accessible only to logged in users, who can create, update and delete events. Users can also comment on the wall of event and delete their own comments.

</Fade>

<Fade>

#### Demo

</Fade>

<Fade>

You can log in with `a@b.com` for email, and `password` for the password.

<Section title="Flappy bird clone">

<Fade>

Clone of the game Flappy Bird, made with <Link href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">P5 Js</Link>. The main challenge here was to save highest scores without backend, which was solved by adding it to local storage.
